# Project---Transistor-and-Diode-detection

Introduction:
In this lab training, we are aimed to:

 practice the work with embedded/integrated systems.

to learn the working of an Arduino board and program it according to the tasks and problem solutions.

What is Arduino and why do we prefer to use Arduino in embedded systems ?

Provide a solution for the given task using the Arduino

Diode & Transistor Detection:
The goal of the lab is to:

 design a circuit using an Arduino board which should be able to detect diodes and transistors.

Configuration of a diode i.e. Forward or Reversed biased diode.

The type of a transistor i.e. a NPN or PNP transistor. 

Indication of the detection results should be printed on the serial console.

Detection of A Diode:
There are many checks we can do to see if a diode is functioning the way it should.
A simple solution to detect a diode is to place it in a circuit.
The diode will either allow or prevent current through the circuit depending on the polarity of the applied voltage.
If
(a) Current flow is permitted; the diode is forward biased and detected.
(b) Current flow is prohibited; the diode is reversed biased.



Detection of A Transistor:
Build a simple circuit and use the transistor as a switch to effectively test the "gain" of the BJT for the two possibilities.
Identifying the NPN Transistor:

Set the positive probe to the (assume itâ€™s Base) pin1 and the negative probe to pin2.

If thereâ€™s a voltage drop then it means pin2 is either Emitter or Collector.

Similarly set the negative probe to the pin-3 (collector) with respect to the pin-2.Â Some voltage drop will be seen again.

It will ensure that it is a NPN transistor. 

The logic behind this is, in NPN transistor Emitter (E) â€“ N type material â€“ Equivalent to cathode of the diode, Base (B) â€“ PÂ type material â€“ Equivalent to anodeÂ of the diode and Collector(C) â€“Â N type material â€“ Equivalent to cathode of the diode

If the positive probe is connected to anode and negative probe is connected to cathode, then it will show voltage. If the connections are interchanged it will not show any value.

Identifying the PNP Transistor:

Set the positive probe to the (assume itâ€™s Emitter) pin1 and the negative probe to pin2.

If thereâ€™s a voltage drop then it means pin2 is Base.Â 

Similarly set the negative probe to the (Base) with respect to the pin-3 (assuming itâ€™s collector).Â There will be again some voltage drop.

It will ensure that it is a PNP transistor. 

The logic behind this is, in PNP transistorÂ Emitter (E) â€“ P type material â€“ Equivalent to anodeÂ of the diode, Base (B) â€“ N type material â€“ Equivalent to cathode of the diode and Collector(C) â€“ P type material â€“ Equivalent to anodeÂ of the diode.

If the positive probe is connected to anode and negative probe is connected to cathode, then it will show voltage. If the connections are interchanged it will not show any value.
